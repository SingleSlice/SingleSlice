## Howdy human ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my github profile, Im Ale, though i prefer being referred to as cake, at least online.
Im a linux addict, no sir, no mac os or windows around me.
- Specifically i use Arch linux and Fedora.

I love programming and learning new computer-related stuff.
- I have a bit of knowledge of python3 and know some Java.
- I do work with databases, currently using MongoDB for my [RevoltChat bot](https://github.com/SingleSlice/Cakebot-Revolt)
- Currently learning Rust and C#.

As for webdev, I love writing adaptive js-free pages, though i may learn javascript and some framework if needed.
